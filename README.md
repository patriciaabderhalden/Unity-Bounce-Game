# Unity-Bounce-Game
For our first game design class we created this game. 

The duration of the project was about nine days. 

We first learned about basic game design principles and game mechanics. After that had a crash-course in Unity and game art. Which equiped us with everything we needed to start the project.

At first we had to choose a verb which would describe the basic game mechanic or principle of the game. This is how our team first met. We then had time to brainstorm and pitch our first ideas. After a successful pitch we started creating the game. 

Finally we created three levels for our game called UWA.
